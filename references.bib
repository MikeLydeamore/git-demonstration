  abstract = {COVID-19 is highly transmissible and containing outbreaks requires a rapid and effective response. Because infection may be spread by people who are pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic, substantial undetected transmission is likely to occur before clinical cases are diagnosed. Thus, when outbreaks occur there is a need to anticipate which populations and locations are at heightened risk of exposure. In this work, we evaluate the utility of aggregate human mobility data for estimating the geographical distribution of transmission risk. We present a simple procedure for producing spatial transmission risk assessments from near-real-time population mobility data. We validate our estimates against three well-documented COVID-19 outbreaks in Australia. Two of these were well-defined transmission clusters and one was a community transmission scenario. Our results indicate that mobility data can be a good predictor of geographical patterns of exposure risk from transmission centres, particularly in outbreaks involving workplaces or other environments associated with habitual travel patterns. For community transmission scenarios, our results demonstrate that mobility data add the most value to risk predictions when case counts are low and spatially clustered. Our method could assist health systems in the allocation of testing resources, and potentially guide the implementation of geographically targeted restrictions on movement and social interaction.},

  abstract = {Objectives The 4 h National Emergency Access Target was introduced in 2011. The Alfred Hospital in Melbourne implemented a hospital-wide clinical service framework, Timely Quality Care (TQC), to enhance patient experience and care quality by improving timeliness of interventions and investigations through the emergency episode and admission to discharge in 2012. We evaluated TQC's effect on achieving the National Emergency Access Target and associated safety and quality indicators. Methods Retrospective analysis with piecewise regression of 215 125 ED attendances before/after implementation, November 2009 to August 2013; with comparison of proportions of patients discharged, admitted or transferred from ED within 4 h of arrival; left at risk; unplanned ED re-attendances up to 28 days; ED length of stay; and in-hospital mortality. Results The percentage of patients admitted, discharged or transferred within 4 h rose from 60\% in 2010, to 74\% in 2013. Median ED length of stay decreased significantly. Rate of unplanned ED re-presentations decreased by 27\%, 22\% and 17\% within 24 h, 48 h and 7 days, respectively; and patient numbers leaving at risk halved from 8\% to 4\%. Mortality for admitted patients declined from 3.5\% to 2.2\%. All results were statistically significant. Conclusions and future directions TQC resulted in improvement in timeliness of care for emergency patients without compromising safety and quality. Success is attributed to effective engagement of stakeholders with a hospital-wide approach to redesigning the care pathway and establishing a new set of principles that underpin care from the time of ED arrival.},
